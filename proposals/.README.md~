# Proposals

Proposals for new specification documents to be adopted by the WG are put here for discussion before being pulled into
a dedicated (new or existing) repo as WG editor's drafts.

The specifications are discussed on the WG [issue list](https://github.com/w3c/webpayments/issues).   
Please use appropriate *"Proposal: XXX"*  labels for new issues to help us sort them.

## Current Proposals

* A spec for [**Payment Apps**](https://w3c.github.io/webpayments/proposals/paymentapps/payment-apps.html) (including registration and processing of payment requests)   
* A proposal for a new architecture specification [**Architecture**](https://w3c.github.io/webpayments/proposals/architecture/)
