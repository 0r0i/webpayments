  <p>The Payment Request API [[!PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]] provides
    a standard way to initiate payment requests from Web pages and
    applications. Browsers implementing that API prompt the user
    to select a way to handle the payment request, after which
    the browser returns a payment response to the originating site.
    This specification adds <strong>payment apps</strong>
    to this user experience. It defines how users
    register payment apps with browsers, how browsers support the display of
    information about payment apps the user can select to handle the
    payment request, how the user selects a payment app, and how communication takes
    place between browsers and payment apps to fulfill the requirements of the
    underlying Payment Request API.</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>The Web Payments Working Group seeks to streamline payments on the Web to
  help reduce payment "abandonment" and make it easier to use
  new payment methods on the Web. It has published the Payment Request
  API [[!PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]] as a standard way to initiate payment
  requests from Web pages and applications. This specification adds
  payment apps to the experience. It
  defines:<p>

    <ul>
      <li>How users register and unregister payment apps with the browser.</li>
      <li>How the browser matches payment methods supported by the payee with those enabled in registered payment apps.</li>
      <li>How the browser displays information about payment apps to the user for selection to handle a payment request.</li>
      <li>How the browser invokes a payment app, communicates input/response data with it, and returns the response data to the underlying Payment Request API.</li>
    </ul>


  <p>Payment apps may be implemented in a variety of ways: as in-browser applications, native operating system applications, browser extensions, built-in browser components, interface-less Web services, or a combination. This specification does not cover every aspect of communication on every platform.</p>

  <p class="note" title="Browser as payment request mediator">The Web Payments Working Group has used the term "mediator" to refer to the software (here, the browser) that carries out the activities defined in this specification (matching, information display, etc.).</p>
</section>
<section id='conformance'>
  <p>Most of the requirements in this specification are for Web browsers (or any other user agent). Some requirements and good practices are for payment apps.</p>

  <h3>Payment App Status</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt><dfn id="dfn-registered-payment-app">registered payment app</dfn></dt>
    <dd>a payment app that is "known" to the browser for the purposes of the interactions described in this document. <strong>Note</strong>: 
      This specification defines a registration mechanism. Other registration mechanisms might co-exist with this one (e.g., on some platforms there may be a way to register a payment app directly with the operating system).</dd>
    <dt><dfn id="dfn-unregistered-payment-app">unregistered payment app</dfn></dt>
    <dd>a payment app that is not known to the browser, either because it has never been registered, or because it has been unregistered.</dd>
    <dt><dfn id="dfn-available-payment-app">available payment app</dfn></dt>
    <dd>a registered payment app with at least one enabled payment method.</dd>
    <!--
    <dt><dfn id="">ignored payment app</dfn></dt>
    <dd>a payment app that, per user configuration, the browser does included in matching computations and does not invoke for payment. A payment app may be ignored for some transactions and not for others.</dd>
    -->
    <dt><dfn id="dfn-recommended-payment-app">recommended payment app</dfn></dt>
    <dd>a payment app suggested by the payee or browser to be registered and used to handle a specific payment request.</dd>
      <p class="note" title="Recommended Payment Apps is still under discussion">
          The Working Group has not yet agreed that the system should support recommended payment apps.
          Inclusion might involve small changes to payment request API.</p>
    <dt><dfn id="">matching payment app</dfn></dt>
    <dd>an available payment app that has at least one enabled payment method accepted by the payee, or a recommended
        payment app with at least one supported payment method accepted by the payee.</dd>
    <dt><dfn id="">selectable payment app</dfn></dt>
    <dd>a matching payment app for which information has been displayed by the browser to facilitate user selection,
        but that has not yet been selected. <strong>Note:</strong> Information about selectable payment apps may be
        displayed in a variety of modalities, including visual and aural.</dd>
    <dt><dfn id="">selected payment app</dfn></dt>
    <dd>the app selected by the user to make a payment, but not yet invoked.</dd>
    <dt><dfn id="">invoked payment app</dfn></dt>
    <dd>the selected payment app that the browser has invoked (executed) and passed payment app input data.</dd>
  </dl>
  <h3>Payment Method Support</h3>
  <dl>
        <dt><dfn id="">supported payment method</dfn></dt>
        <dd>a payment method that a payment app has been designed to support however, this payment method may or may
            not currently be enabled. A payment app may support more than one payment method.</dd>
        <dt><dfn id="">unsupported payment method</dfn></dt>
        <dd>a payment method that can noit be enabled by a payment app. Updates to a payment app may cause an
            unsupported payment method to become supported.</dd>
        <dt><dfn id="">enabled payment method </dfn></dt>
        <dd>a payment method that the currently registered payment app is able to handle. The set of enabled payment
            methods for a payment app is either the set or a subset of the supported payment methods.</dd>
        <p class="note" title="Supported vs enabled Payment Methods">
            The difference between supported and enabled payment methods is one of design-time vs runtime consideration.
            A Payment App supports all the payment methods it was designed to support however at runtime only a subset
            may be enabled due to configuration or other runtime requirements that may not have been met for all
            supported payment methods.
        </p>
        <!--
        <dt><dfn id="">enabled payment instrument</dfn></dt>
        <dd>the data that the user has provided when configuring the payment app; the nature of the data depends on the
        payment method (e.g., for legacy card payments, a card number and expiration date). <strong>Note</strong>:
        We don't yet know whether we need the term "instrument" in this document. It may suffice to say that the user
        selected a payment app and we do not need to know what happens in detail. However, if the group chooses to
        expose the concept of instrument (e.g., so that the browser may display instrument details) we may need this
        definition and similar ones.</dd>
        -->
  </dl>
  <h3>Payment App Invocation and Response Data</h3>
    <dl>
    <dt><dfn id="">selected payment instrument</dfn></dt>
    <dd>the payment instrument selected by the user within the payment app to make a payment.</dd>
    <dt><dfn id="">payment app invocation data</dfn></dt>
    <dd>Data provided to the invoked payment app by the browser. This data is a subset of data input to the Payment Request API. <strong>Note:</strong> We expect this data to be serialized as JSON.</dd>
    <dt><dfn id="">payment app response data</dfn></dt>
    <dd>Data provided by an invoked payment app to the browser, typically after payment authorization or other action taken through the payment app. This data, which will vary according to payment method, is then passed through the Payment Request API as the payment response.</dd>

<section id="model">
  <h2>Payment App Model and Design Considerations</h2>
  <p>This section (which may be temporary) intends to help build shared understanding of the capabilities and limitations of the specified model.</p>
  <section>
    <h3>General Considerations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>This specification builds on PaymentRequest API.</li>
      <li>It defines mechanisms that may be used to support
	both Web-based and native payment apps. However, we anticipate
	that the ecosystem will also include proprietary approaches
	to some of the functionality defined here (e.g., payment app registration or invocation).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Registration and Unregistration</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The user registers a payment app with the browser, which provides developers with primitives for this purpose. For example, when using Web-based payment, the user can push a button to register the payment app. When using a native app, the native app can open a Web page that supports registration.</li>
      <li>During registration, information about supported and enabled payment methods is provided to the browser. The browser caches this information for subsequent actions (e.g., when matching merchant-accepted payment methods). In this proposal, there are no requirements for a payment app to be able to respond to browser queries for updated registration information. We expect payment apps to implement updates in a variety of ways (e.g., through push notifications and service workers, followed by re-registration).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Payment App Matching</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>When the user invokes the Payment Request API (by, for example, "pushing the Buy button"), the browser computes the intersection between merchant-accepted payment methods and user-registered payment methods. It does this by comparing Payment Request API data (from the payee) and payment app registration data, invoking the comparison algorithm defined in the Payment Method Identifier specification. The result is a list of matching payment apps.</li>
      <li>Using information provided during registration,the browser displays matching payment apps for selection by the user. </li>
      <li>The browser may also display merchant-specified or browser-specified recommended payment apps, which are displayed distinctly for the user. This mechanism is intended to support use cases such as a merchant recommending their own payment app to the user, or the browser helping the user find payment apps that are relevant for a transaction but that the user has not yet registered.</li>
      <li>The browser may offer features to facilitate selection (e.g., launch a chosen payment app every time the user wants to pay at a given Web site); those features lie outside the scope of this specification.</li>
      <li>The user selects a payment app to make a payment. If the user selected a recommended payment app, behavior depends on whether the payment app is unregistered or registered.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Payment App Invocation and Response</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Based on information provided at registration, the browser "launches" the payment app and provides it with input data drawn from the Payment Request API.</li>
      <li>This specification defines an HTTP-based mechanism for providing input data to the payment app. In some systems, payment apps may bypass this mechanism entirely, but that behavior lies outside the scope of this specification.</li>
      <li>The user may interact with the payment app in a variety of ways to authorize payment, cancel the transaction, or carry out other activities supported by the payment app. This specification does not address payment app behavior other than accepting requests and returning responses to the browser.</li>
      <li>This specification defines a means for the browser to receive a response asynchronously once the user has authorized payment. The response becomes the response of the Payment Request API.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Network Considerations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>This specification only describes communication between the browser and the payment app. This includes an asynchronous mechanism for a payment app to return a payment response to the browser. This specification does not address scenarios where the browser does not receive the response (e.g., due to a crash our network outage).</li>
      <li>This specification does not address communication between the payee server and the payee Web app, or between the payment app and other parties (e.g., the payment app distibutor, or directly to the merchant).</li>

  <h2>Payment App Registration and Unregistration</h2>

  <p>To support registration and unregistration, the browser provides
  primitives that may be called from within a Web page or
  application. For example, the user might visit a Web-based payment
  app and push a "Register payment app" to invoke the browser
  primitives.</p>
    
  <section>
    <h3>Registration</h3>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>start_url</code> in the PaymentApp dictionary assumes an HTTP approach to communication between the browser and the payment app. The Working Group is currently exploring other approaches to communication as well; this particular proposal has been included to foster discussion.</p>

       <h4>Discussion Notes on Registration</h4>
       <ul>
	 <li>At each registration, the browser <span class='rfc2119'>MUST</span> replace all previous registration information with the new registration information. Payment apps  <span class='rfc2119'>MAY</span> use this feature to provide updates.</li>
	 <li>Todo: Confirm that is the registration approach we wish to take. HTTP or JavaScript? What is the role of service workers?</li>
	 <li><strong>Question</strong>. Should the registration data also include details about payment instruments? This would allow the browser to display more detail and facilitate selection. The details might not be "all the information" but enough (e.g., a user-provided label) to guide user selection. The browser might also use this information to improve per-instrument pricing.</li>
	 <li><strong>Question</strong>: What, if anything, should we say about registering native payment apps? Should we publish separate "good practices" documents for different platforms?</li>

  <h2>Payment App Matching</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Dependency: We anticipate that the Payment Method Identifier specification will define the PMI matching algorithm. The current specification will explain how to invoke that algorithm using data available from the Payment Request API input and payment method information aggregated from:
      <ul>
	<li>enabled payment methods across all registered payment apps.</li>
	<li>supported payment methods of recommended but unregistered payment apps</li>

      <li>In its display, the browser <span class='rfc2119'>MUST</span> distinguish recommended payment apps from other payment apps.</li>
      <li>The browser <span class='rfc2119'>MAY</span> allow the user to configure the display of matching payment apps.</li>
      <li>The browser <span class='rfc2119'>MUST</span> display matching payment apps in an order that corresponds to the order of supported payment methods supplied by the payee, except where the browser enables the user to override this order.</li>
      <li>The browser <span class='rfc2119'>SHOULD</span> display any payee-recommended apps in the order specified by the payee.</li>
      <li><strong>Question</strong> What information is needed by the browser to display selectable apps? Should instrument-specific information (e.g., mnemonic labels) be passed through to help with selection?</li>
      <li><strong>Question</strong> Which of these scenarios do we expect to support through the set of technologies, and should we seek to harmonize the user experience across them?

  <h2>Payment App Invocation and Response</h2>
  <p>Once the user has selected a payment app, the browser is responsible
    for preparing payment app invocation data, providing it to the payment app for processing, and returning the payment app response through the Payment Request API. This specification defines an HTTP-based mechanism to provide data to the payment app. Payment apps may use a variety of mechanisms to handle the incoming data, including server-side processing, or client-side interception of the HTTP message by a service worker. </p>
  <section>
    <h3>Invocation Data</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Todo: define the shape of the payment app invocation data: Let P be the intersection of payment methods supported by the payee and enabled by the selected app. Send the data corresponding to P, as well as any global transaction data (total, etc.) to the payment app. The details depend on discussions about the shape of the Payment Request API.</li>
      </ul>
  </section>

    <h3>Payment App Invocation</h3>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> The Working Group is still discussing
      how to invoke payment apps (e.g., via an HTTP POST
      to <code>start_url</code> or by executing a piece of JS provided
      at registration). The following algorithm assumes an HTTP POST
      approach.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Let <var>payment request</var> be the string that is the
          outcome of the steps to prepare the payment app invocation data.</li>

	<li><strong>Question</strong>: What, if anything, should we say about launching native payment apps? Should we publish separate "good practices" documents for different platforms?</li>
	<li><strong>Question</strong>: Communication mail fail at various points in the flow, including between server and payment app:

	    <li>Payment server to payment app</li>
	    <li>Payment app to browser</li>
	    <li>Payee Web app to payee server</li>
	  </ul>
	  What sort of guarantees should we endeavor to provide, if any, for any of these points in the flow? If, for examle, a proof of payment is lost
	  along the communication flow, then, for instance, a merchant might not shiop goods. Some observations:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Today, backchannel communications are often used (e.g., between payment server and payee server).</li>
	    <li>The payee could provide a callback URL (identified as such in a standard way). This would allow (but not require) the payment app to communicate with the payee server until such time as all parties are satisfied they share the same view of the payment response.</li>
	    <li>An alternative is to ensure that the payment app and the browser have a channel so that communication continues until all aprties are satisfied they share the same view of the payment response. This might involve caching payment responses.</li>
