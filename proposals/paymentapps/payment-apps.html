    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Payment Request API [[!PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]] defines an API for websites to initiate a payment request
        which is then passed to a <a>Payment App</a> for processing.</p>

    <p>The <a>Payment App</a> is a software application that is registered by the payer with the <a>user agent</a>
        to process payments that are iniated via the API. <a>Payment Apps</a> support one or more <a>payment methods</a>
        for processing payments initiated via the Payment Request API.</p>

    <p>The Payment Request API [[!PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]] specification describes how the <a>user agent</a>, acting
        as a mediator between the payee website and the payer, assists the user in selecting a <a>Payment App</a>
        that can process the payment request, using at least one of the <a>payment methods</a> that is also supported by
        the payee. The specification then prescribes that the <a>user agent</a> forward the payment request to that app
        for processing before returning the response to the calling Website.</p>

    <p>This specification describes:
        <ul>
            <li>How payment app publishers register <a>Payment Apps</a> with the <a>user agent</a>.</li>
            <li>How the user agent maintains the list of payment methods that are enabled by the payment app.</li>
            <li>How, after the user selects a payment app to use, the payment request MAY be passed to the
                <a>payment app</a>.</li>
            <li>How a payment response MAY then returned by the app to the <a>user agent</a>?</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>The API described in this document forms part of the Payment Request system described in
        the Payment Request Architecture [[!PAYMENT-ARCH]] document.</p>

    <section id="goals">
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Allow users to register <a>payment apps</a> with their user agent such that the user agent is able to maintain
                a registry of the <a>payment methods</a> that are enabled by the app.</li>
            <li>Allow <a>payment apps</a> to update the set of <a>payment methods</a> that they have enabled.</li>
            <li>Standardize a platform-independant mechanism for a <a>user agent</a> to switch focus to a <a>payment app</a>
                and pass it a payment request.</li>
            <li>Allow for the publishing of <a>payment apps</a> on any platform, with or without a user interface.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="non-goals">
        <h2>Non-goals</h2>
        <p>This specification does not attempt to define the full set of interfaces between the <a>user agent</a>
        and the selected <a>payment app</a> as it is anticipated that <a>payment apps</a> will be implemented on a
        variety of platforms and that the interfaces between the <a>user agent</a> and apps on platforms other
        than the Web will be implementation specific.</p>

<section id='conformance'>
    <div class="issue" data-number="" title="What are the appropriate conformance criteria for user agents and apps?">
        <p>This specification describes a mechanism that all user agents MUST support in order to allow for third party payment
        apps to be published and used from that user agent, however user agents may also have built in payment apps or allow
        other types of payment app such as browser extensions. How the integration works for these is implementation specific
        so we need to word the conformance criteria appropriately.</p>
        <p> Also, we should look at the conformance criteria for user agents as defined in [[!APPMANIFEST]].</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        This specification defines one class of products:
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt><dfn>Conforming user agent</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                A <dfn data-lt="user agents">user agent</dfn> MUST behave as described in this specification
                in order to be considered conformant. In this specification, <a>user agent</a> means a <em>Web
                browser or other interactive user agent</em> as defined in [[!HTML5]].
            </p>
            <p>
                User agents MAY implement algorithms given in this
                specification in any way desired, so long as the end result is
                indistinguishable from the result that would be obtained by the
                specification's algorithms.
            </p>
            <p>
                A conforming user agent MUST also be a
                <em>conforming implementation</em> of the IDL fragments
                of this specification, as described in the
                “Web IDL” specification. [[!WEBIDL]]
            </p>

            <aside class="note">
                This specification uses both the terms "conforming user agent(s)"
                and "user agent(s)" to refer to this product class.

    <h2>Payment Apps</h2>

    <p><dfn data-lt="payment apps|payment app">Payment Apps</dfn> are a specialized form of <a>installable application</a> as
        defined in [[!APPMANIFEST]]. They could take the form of Web apps, interface-less Web services,
        platform-specific native applications or even <a>user agent</a> components or extensions.</p>

    <p>The <a>Payment App</a> acts on behalf of the payer (or their chosen payment services provider) and performs any
        logic required for the chosen <a>payment method</a> to process the payment. This might include steps like authentication
        of the payer and confirmation of the payment details.</p>

    <p>The specific processing required by the <a>Payment App</a>, including the format of the payment request
        that the app accepts and the format of the reponse it returns, is defined by the
        <a>Payment Transaction Message Specification</a> for the <a>payment method</a> that is used to process the
        transaction.</p>
    <section>
        <h3>Supported vs Enabled Payment Methods</h3>
        <p><a>Payment Apps</a> support one or more <a>payment methods</a>. Support for a payment method implies that the app
            SHOULD be able to process a payment request that conforms to the rules defined in the <a>Payment Transaction Message
                Specification</a> for that payment method and SHOULD be able to return an appropriate response.
        </p>
        <p>However, sometimes an app will be designed to support a specific payment method but the app will not have been configured
            with the appropriate <a>payment method data</a> (such as user credentials) to process payments using that payment method. In
            that case the <a>payment app</a> is said to <code>support</code> the payment method but that payment method is not
            <code>enabled</code>.
        </p>
        <p>For example, a <a>payment app</a> may be capable of processing a basic card payment that simply returns the card
            details in the payment response but unless the user has configure the payment app with the card details or is able to
            provide these at the time of processing that method is not <code>enabled</code>.
        </p>
        <p>If a payment app defines a payment method as <code>enabled</code> then it MUST be able to process any payment request
            that lists that that payment method as supported and is formatted correctly according to the <a>Payment Transaction Message
                Specification</a> for that payment method.
        </p>
        <p><a>User agents</a> should only consider <code>enabled</code> payment methods when evaluating if a <a>payment app</a> is
            appropriate to process a given payment request.</p>
    </section>
</section>


<section>
    <h2>Registering a Payment App</h2>
    <p>In order to begin processing payment requests from the <a>user agent</a> a <a>payment app</a> must first be
        registered so that the <a>user agent</a> is aware of the set of <a>payment methods</a> the app has enabled.
    </p>
    <p>The process of <a>Payment App</a> registration follows the process defined for <a>installing</a> an application
    via a <a>manifest</a>, as described in [[!APPMANIFEST]] but with some custom behavior defined at the
        <a>extension point</a> in the algorithm <a>steps for processing a manifest</a>.</p>
    <p>This specifcation also defines an extra mechanism for triggering the installation process via an API call as
        described in <a><code>registerPaymentApp</code></a>.</p>
    <section>
        <h3>Manifest and its members</h3>
        <div class="issue" data-number="" title="PaymentApp should extend a base manifest object">
            Unfortunately the [[!APPMANIFEST]] specification does not have a way of installing a manifest via a browser
            API so there is no WebIDL object definition of the basic manifest. It is declared here but a PR will be made
            against the [[!APPMANIFEST]] specification to include it there following which this section could be removed.
        </div>
        <div class="issue" data-number="" title="'actions' is defined in the Ballista project">
            The <a href="https://github.com/chromium/ballista/">Ballista project</a> defines a mechanism for extending
            [[!APPMANIFEST]] to describe the actions that an application can perform. This specification follows a similar
            pattern in the hope that it will be compatible with Ballista should it be implemented in future.

    <h2>Processing Payment Requests</h2>
    <p>
        When a <a>user agent</a> has completed the <a>payment app</a> selection algorithm as defined in the PaymentRequest
        API [[!PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]] it must initiate the selected <a>payment app</a> and pass it the payment request to
        process.</p>
    <p>
        The <a>user agent</a> does this by, converting the payment request into a JSON serialized object, executing
        an HTTP POST request against the <code>start_url</code> defined in the <a>payment app</a>'s <a>manifest</a> and
        then using the response to determine what type of <a>payment app</a> to instantiate and how to interface to that
        app.
    </p>
    <p>
        This specification explicitly ctare for three categories of <a>payment app</a> however others may be defined by
        implementers who also define a custom mechanism for the <a>user agent</a> to instantiate and interface with
        these apps.
    </p>
    <p>At a minimum the <a>user agent</a> MUST handle the following two responses from the <a>payment app</a>:
        <ol>
            <li>An HTML response that MUST rendered by the <a>user agent</a> in the <a>application context</a> defined
                by the <a>payment app</a>'s <a>manifest</a>.</li>
            <li>A JSON serialized payment response which is converted by the <a>user agent</a> into a <a>PaymentResponse</a>
            object. The <a>Promise</a> that was returned to the payee website when calling <a><code>PaymentRequest.show</code></a>
                MUST resolve to this <a>PaymentResponse</a>.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <section>
        <h3>Converting the <a>PaymentRequest</a> into JSON.</h3>
        <p>Before the <a>PaymentRequest</a> can be submitted to the <a>payment app</a> it must be converted into a JSON
        serialized string.</p>
        <p>This step can be skipped if the selected <a>payment app</a> is internal to the <a>user agent</a> or integrates
        with the <a>user agent</a> through a non-standard interface that does not require the <a>PaymentRequest</a>
        to be converted.</p>
        <p>The <dfn>steps to convert the <code>PaymentRequest</code> to JSON</dfn> are given by the following algorithm. The
        algorithm takes a <a>PaymentRequest</a> (<var>request</var>) as input and returns a string.</p>
        <div class="issue" data-number="" title="Need to define an algorithm for converting the PaymentRequest to JSON">
            The algortihm for this conversion will depend on the outcome of discussions around the shape of the PaymentRequest
            API. This algorithm may also sit in the messages/extensibility spec.
