  <p>The Payment Request API [[!PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]] provides
    a standard way to initiate payment requests from Web pages and
    applications. Browsers implementing that API prompt the user
    to select a payment method and authorize payment, after which
    the browser returns a payment response to the originating site.
    The current specification adds <strong>payment apps</strong>
    to this user experience. It defines how users
    register payment apps with browsers, how browsers support the display of information matching payment apps, how the user selects on, and how communication takes
    place between browsers and selected payment apps to fulfill the requirements of the underlying Payment Request API.</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>The Web Payments Working Group seeks to streamline checkout to
  help reduce "shopping cart abandonment" and make it easier to use
  new payment methods on the Web. It has published the Payment Request
  API [[!PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]] as a standard way to initiate payment
  requests from Web pages and applications. This specification adds
  payment apps to the experience. It
  defines:<p>

    <ul>
      <li>How users register and unregister payment apps with the browser, and how browsers learn when the user updates a payment app.</li>
      <li>How the browser matches payment methods supported by the payee with those available in registered payment apps.</li>
      <li>How the browser displays information about matching payment apps to the user for selection to make a payment.</li>
      <li>How the browser invokes a selected payment app, communicates input/response data with it, and returns the response data to the underlying Payment Request API.</li>
    </ul>


  <p>Payment apps may be implemented in a variety of ways: as in-browser applications, native operating system applications, browser extensions, built-in browser components, interface-less Web services, or a combination. This specification does not cover every aspect of communication on every platform.</p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The Web Payments Working Group has used the term "mediator" to refer to the software (here, the browser) that carries out the activities defined in this specification (matching, information display, etc.).</p>
</section>
<section id='conformance'>
  <p>Most of the requirements in this specification are for Web browsers (or any other user agent). Some requirements and good practices are for payment apps.</p>

  <h2>Definitions</h2>
  <h3>Payment App Implementation Technology</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt><dfn id="">browser-based payment app</dfn></dt>
    <dd>a payment app that runs in a browser.</dd>
    <dt><dfn id="">headless Web payment app</dfn></dt>
    <dd>a payment app that has no user interface but communicates using Web technology (such as HTTP).</dd>
    <dt><dfn id="">web-based payment app</dfn></dt>
    <dd>a browser-based or headless Web payment app.</dd>
    <dt><dfn id="">native payment app</dfn></dt>
    <dd>a payment app built with the operating system default technology stack that uses non-Web technologies.</dd>
  </dl>
  <h3>Payment Method Support</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt><dfn id="">supported payment method</dfn></dt>
    <dd>a payment method that a user may configure a payment app to use, but for which the user has not provided data. A payment app may support more than one payment method.</dd>
    <dt><dfn id="">unsupported payment method</dfn></dt>
    <dd>a payment method that a user cannot configure a payment app to use. Note that updates to a payment app may cause an unsupported payment method to becomes supported.</dd>
    <dt><dfn id="">enabled payment method </dfn></dt>
    <dd>a payment method that a user has configured a payment app to use.</dd>
    <dt><dfn id="">enabled payment instrument</dfn></dt>
    <dd>the data that the user has provided when configuring the payment app; the nature of the data depends on the payment method (e.g., for legacy card payments, a card number and expiration date). <strong>Note</strong>: We don't yet know whether we need the term "instrument" in this document. It may suffice to say that the user selected a payment app and we do not need to know what happens in detail. However, if the group chooses to expose the concept of instrument (e.g., so that the browser may display instrument details) we may need this definition and similar ones.</dd>
  </dl>
  
  <h3>Payment App Status</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt><dfn id="">registered payment app</dfn></dt>
    <dd>a payment app that is "known" to the browser for the purposes of the interactions described in this document. This specification does not limit how registration may take place (e.g., directly with a browser, or with an underlying operating system). </dd>
    <dt><dfn id="">unregistered payment app</dfn></dt>
    <dd>a payment app that is unknown to the browser, either because it has never been registered, or because it has been unregistered.</dd>
    <dt><dfn id="">enabled payment app</dfn></dt>
    <dd>a registered payment app with at least one enabled payment method.</dd>
    <dt><dfn id="">ignored payment app</dfn></dt>
    <dd>a payment app that, per user configuration, the browser does included in matching computations and does not invoke for payment. A payment app may be ignored for some transactions and not for others.</dd>
    <dt><dfn id="">recommended payment app</dfn></dt>
    <dd>a payment app identified by the payee or browser that may be enabled, or just registered, or unregistered. <strong>Note:</strong> The Working Group has not yet agreed that the system should support recommended payment apps. Inclusion might involve small changes to payment request API.</dd>
    <dt><dfn id="">matching payment app</dfn></dt>
    <dd>a non-ignored payment app that is either enabled with one enabled payment method accepted by the payee, or recommended with one supported payment method accepted by the payee.</dd>
    <dt><dfn id="">selectable payment app</dfn></dt>
    <dd>a matching payment app for which information has been displayed by the browser to facilitate user selection, but that has not yet been selected. <strong>Note:</strong> Information about selectable payment apps may be displayed in a variety of modalities, including visual and aural.</dd>
    <dt><dfn id="">selected payment app</dfn></dt>
    <dd>the app selected by the user to make a payment, but not yet invoked.</dd>
    <dt><dfn id="">invoked payment app</dfn></dt>
    <dd>the selected payment app that the browser has invoked (executed) and passed payment app input data.</dd>
  </dl>
  <h3>Payment App Invocation and Response Data</h3>
    <dl>
    <dt><dfn id="">selected payment instrument</dfn></dt>
    <dd>the payment instrument selected by the user within the payment app to make a payment.</dd>
    <dt><dfn id="">payment app invocation data</dfn></dt>
    <dd>Data provided to the invoked payment app by the browser. This data is a subset of data input to the Payment Request API. <strong>Note:</strong> We expect this data to be serialized as JSON.</dd>
    <dt><dfn id="">payment app response data</dfn></dt>
    <dd>Data provided by an invoked payment app to the browser, typically after payment authorization or other action taken through the payment app. This data, which will vary according to payment method, is then passed through the Payment Request API as the payment response.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>Payment App Registration, Updates, and Unregistration</h2>
  <section>
    <h3>Registration</h3>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>start_url</code> in the PaymentApp dictionary assumes an HTTP approach to communication between the browser and the payment app. The Working Group is currently exploring other approaches to communication as well; this particular proposal has been included to foster discussion.</p>

       <h4>Discussion Notes on Registration</h4>
       <ul>
	 <li>Todo: Confirm that is the registration approach we wish to take. HTTP or JavaScript? What is the role of service workers?</li>
	 <li><strong>Question</strong>. Should the registration data also include details about payment instruments? This would allow the browser to display more detail and facilitate selection. The details might not be "all the information" but enough (e.g., "last four digits of the card") to guide user selection. The browser might also use this information to improve per-instrument pricing.</li>
	 <li><strong>Question</strong>: What, if anything, should we say about registering native payment apps? Should we publish separate "good practices" documents for different platforms?</li>

  <h2>Payment App Matching</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Dependency: We anticipate that the Payment Method Identifier specification will define the PMI matching algorithm. The current specification will explain how to invoke that algorithm using data available from the Payment Request API input and payment method information aggregated from:
      <ul>
	<li>enabled payment methods across all registered payment apps.</li>
	<li>supported payment methods of recommended but unregistered payment apps</li>
      </ul>

  <h2>Payment App Invocation and Response</h2>
  <p>Once the user has selected a payment app, the browser is responsible
    for preparing payment app invocation data, providing it to the payment app for processing, and returning the payment app response through the Payment Request API.</p>
  <section>
    <h3>Invocation Data</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Todo: define the shape of the payment app invocation data: Let P be the intersection of payment methods supported by the payee and enabled by the selected app. Send the data corresponding to P, as well as any global transaction data (total, etc.) to the payment app. The details depend on discussions about the shape of the Payment Request API.</li>
      </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Payment App Invocation</h3>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> The Working Group is still discussing
      how to invoke payment apps (e.g., via an HTTP POST
      to <code>start_url</code> or by executing a piece of JS provided
      at registration). The following algorithm assumes an HTTP POST
      approach.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Let <var>payment request</var> be the string that is the
          outcome of the steps to prepare the payment app invocation data.</li>
        <li>Let <var>payment app</var> be the selcted payment app.
          <div class="issue" data-number="" title=
               "What are the appriate fetch parameters for this request?">We
            should get input form Web Platform and WebAppSec on how to best
            construct this request.</div>
        </li>
        <li>Let <var>request</var> be a new [[!FETCH]] <a>request</a>,
          whose members are set to the following values:
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>Member</th>
              <th>Value</th>

            <tr>
              <td><code><a>URL</a></code></td>
              <td>The value of the <code>start_url</code> member of <var>payment

        <li>Await the result of performing a <a>fetch</a> with
          <var>request</var>, letting <var>response</var> be the result.</li>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> The Working Group is still discussing how payment apps are instantiated for user interaction.</p>
    
    <section>
      <h4>Browser-based Payment Apps</h4>

      <ul>
	<li>When payment app response data is <code>text/html</code>, the
      browser renders the <a>Response</a> in a new top-level browsing
      context. Browser-based payment
      apps <span class='rfc2119'>MUST</span> run in a secure
	  context.</li>
	<li>When the user has authorized payment, the payment app
	  returns a <a>PaymentResponse</a> to the browser
	  calling<code>submitPaymentResponse</code> (see below).</li>
	<li><strong>Question</strong> How should the browser render the browser-based payment app? Should this be in an iframe, in a special modal dialogue or just a new tab? Is this an implementation detail?</li>
      </ul>

	<code>submitPaymentResponse</code> then
        set <var>response</var> equal to the first parameter passed to
        that method.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, if the <a>steps to submit the
          payment request to the payment app</a> resulted in the
        return of a JSON encoded <a>PaymentResponse</a> then set
        <var>response</var> to the result of running the <a>steps to create
          a <code>PaymentResponse</code> from JSON</a>.</li>

  <h2>Security and Privacy Considerations</h2>
  <section>
    <h3>Design Considerations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The API does not share information about the user's registered payment methods or payment apps with the payee. The only information that is shared is the result of user selection.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h3>Secure Communications</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/service-workers/#security-considerations">Service Worker security considerations</a></li>
      <li>Payment method security is outside the scope of this specification and is addressed by payment apps that support those payment methods.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Data Validation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Payees should validate that the data they have received through the paymentRequest API is what they expect (e.g., the total that was paid, etc.).</li>
